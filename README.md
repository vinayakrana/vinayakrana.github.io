Note: If using this repo as a template for a new repo of yours, remember to check 'Include all branches' when creating the repository (because we will need the gh-pages branch to host the website).

Remember to also update the links to your GitHub repo in [_quarto.yml](https://github.com/Pakillo/quarto-course-website-template/blob/main/_quarto.yml)
